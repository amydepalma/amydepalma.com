                <p>The goal when redesigning Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust's website was to make the information easy-to-find and concise as the organization's existing site was outdated and filled with redundant information. With that in mind, we evaluated their site's current content and design to determine the best strategy going forward to reach this goal.
