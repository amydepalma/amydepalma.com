            <p>The Midwife Center is western PA's largest and only freestanding birth center offering primary gynecological, prenatal, and childbirth care. I've been fortunate enough to work with this wonderful organization since 2012. Through the years, I've partnered with TMC on various graphic design projects, from larger publications such as their Capital Campaign and 30th Anniversary Report to small projects such as postcards and invitations. Iâ€™ve also been a proud materials-sponsor of their annual fundraiser and (delicious) cake decorating contest, Let Them Eat Cake.</p>
